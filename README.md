DYLESS ,DYnamic LEarning Simulation System

AIM:Students Can learn in Digital way,in PC platform 
Change the way to learn and study.

Secondary School/Middle School+High School Syllabus
Currently in an Independent School named Sabah Tshung Tsin Secondary School.
Currently in Beta Networking mode,

Future Target:
1)Dynamic Language and Mathematical Input(Cast) That Have Output 
(Calculus,AI,Language recognition at Server Side);
2)Dynamic Biological Simulation
(Heart is a object of Plyr,Heart have status, Like Low Blood pressure,Affect Input,Animation will change)
3)Dynamic Mathmatical Resolving W player Input
(e.g.Obj allow Player Fly to Input Point in z-axis"front,Ply Input:cos60,comp need to resolve,into value)
=output : Coefficient(1)Value by cos 60(0.5)=0.5 m ,forward
4)=3)In a way, Just Physics Manipulation
5)Plyr that have accurate physics resolving.
